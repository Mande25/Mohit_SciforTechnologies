This is the first project which i have done during my training.

CRYPTOCURRENCY INTERACTIVE DASHBOARD
In this project i have used the kaggle dataset of bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum for making analysis of each coin and then just created a dashboard which can filter coins and analyze their charts and gain some insights.


Steps to be followed:
i. Download all the three datasets of bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum
ii. Download the script file with .py extension named Dashboard1.py and Dashboard2.py
iii. pip install streamlit if streamlit is not installed
iv. replace the path of the dataset with your path where installed.
v. run the script with your_filename.py using command streamlit run your_filename.py
